The "SenselDisableSerialBlock" executables are simple apps that allow you to use the API and "regular" output like MIDI from the Morph at the same time.
* Connect your Morph via USB to your computer. 
* Launch the program from the Finder or Explorer with a double-click. This opens a terminal window.
* You'll get feedback that a device is found (or not). 

Once the device is found, you'll know things are in good shape if the output reads:
```

```

On a Mac, you'll likely get a warning that the app is from an unidentified developer, since this is not signed. 
You can open your System Preferences -> Security and Privacy and allow the app to open.
